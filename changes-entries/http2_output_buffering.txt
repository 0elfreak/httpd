  *) mod_http2: new option 'H2OutputBuffering on/off' which controls the 
     buffering of stream output. The default is on, which is the behaviour of 
     previous mod-h2 versions. When off, all bytes are made available immediately 
     to the main connection for sending them out to the client. This fixes interop 
     issues with certain flavours of gRPC. [Stefan Eissing]
