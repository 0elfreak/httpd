  *) mod_http2: Fixed reporting of transferred bytes for mod_logio for 
     modifiers %O (and %S) to report the number of transferred header and 
     body lengths. This is still only an approximation of the bytes on the 
     connection. The data is subject to header compression and h2 framing 
     afterwards. [Stefan Eissing]
